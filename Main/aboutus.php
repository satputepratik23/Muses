"Muses studio " is inspired by the 9 greek godesses who have been an inspiration to the artist from antiquity till eternity. We at muses provide a perfect space with decent equipment and acoustics for musicans to practice and create their next master piece .<br><br>
<p>
	A rich cultural heritage and a strong musical inclination led to the creation of this beautiful space.
	Sagar Harale co-founded The Muses Studio to keep theirs and others passion alive.
